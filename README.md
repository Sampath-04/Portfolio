### Hi there, I'm Sampath! ğŸ‘‹
- ğŸ•º A software engineer who doubles as an artist, wielding both code and brush with equal skill. When not crafting code or creating art, you'll find me unwinding with anime for some well-deserved entertainment.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.js while sharpening my skills in Java, JavaScript, and React. 
- ğŸ’» Check out these two Apps that I built from scratch and am most proud of:
     - [Natours](https://github.com/sampath-ops/natours) 
     - [E-Tech](https://github.com/sampath-ops/E-Tech)
